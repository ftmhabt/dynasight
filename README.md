component structure:

**1. Data Source Component:**

- Handles fetching data from real-time sources (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events) or a simulated data stream.
- Might use libraries like `socket.io-client` or implement polling mechanisms.
- Should have types for incoming data using TypeScript interfaces.

**2. Data Processing Component:**

- Transforms raw data into a format suitable for visualization.
- May involve filtering, aggregation, or calculations.
- Leverages TypeScript for data type safety and manipulation.

**3. Visualization Component:**

- Renders the processed data using a charting library like Chart.js, D3.js, or React-Vis.
- Chooses the appropriate chart type (line, bar, gauge, etc.) based on data properties.
- Employs TypeScript types for chart configurations and data.

**4. Layout Component:**

- Manages the overall dashboard layout, arranging data source, processing, and visualization components.
- Might use a grid system like Flexbox or CSS Grid for responsive design.
- Can leverage TypeScript for component props and state management.

**5. User Interaction Component (Optional):**

- Handles user interactions like filtering data by time range, selecting specific metrics, or zooming in/out of charts.
- May trigger updates to the data source or processing components.
- Utilizes TypeScript for user input types and event handling.

**6. App Component:**

- The root component that orchestrates other components.
- Manages application state (potentially using Redux or Context API).
- Provides context for data and user interactions.
- Employs TypeScript for global state types and application logic.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** Implements mechanisms to handle potential errors during data fetching or processing. Display user-friendly error messages.
- **Loading State:** Shows a loading indicator while data is being fetched or processed.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensures the dashboard layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries or responsive libraries.
